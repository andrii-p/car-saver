      "postBody": "This 2012 Subaru Impreza is in wonderful condition, has custom leather seats and white pearl paint job with a sport premium Trim. For those who don't know, the Impreza is excellent on gas mileage and has wonderful life span as well as generally easy up keep. The car has AUX/USB hookups for music and phone built in, features a Bluetooth phone connection option, and has a great sound system (nothing custom). On top of that the car is AWD, so driving in the snow is a blast! This car is still mostly owned by the bank, so selling would go down with or at a financial institution. It's really quite easy if you're willing to take a loan, but we can go over details of course. Shoot me an email and I would be happy to chat with you! P.S. No low ball offers, you can try to scam me but it won't work and I am very experienced with cars so I wont be swindled. Thanks!",

I'm willing to negotiate on the price but not by much. It's a solid car with a whole life ahead of it. No interior damage. No animal hair or funk and has had a garage parking spot the whole time I've owned it. The title still has a lien with the bank. So if you're seriously interested in purchasing it we will be heading to the bank to handle the lien and get the title. Just wanted to put that out there upfront.

The tires have plenty of life left on them, and partnered with the all wheel drive I have had no problems navigating the winters. It had the clutch replaced at 68,000 miles due to a broken throw-out bearing; has a lifetime warranty on the new clutch! It has a clean Carfax and I have the clean title in hand. It does have some cosmetic curb rash on the bumper and wheels as well as normal cosmetic wear for a 5 year old vehicle, but other than that it is in excellent condition. It has almost all highway miles and gets on average 32-33 mpg.

Since then, I have purchased a brand new computer (central control module), have replaced the struts (both are brand new), new brakes in front, and kept up with maintenance. I have put in brand new rubber mats and will provide the carpet ones as well. I will include the bike rack if you are interested in it. This car is all wheel drive and has a Bluetooth stereo. There is some slight body damage, nothing major, and the car makes a noise occasionally when going over a bump on front driver side. 3 mechanics have assured me that this does not affect anything mechanically or compromise safety. I recently just put brand new Hancock tires and had older Subaru rims professionally painted/powder coated and installed. I have driven around 50 miles on the tires so they are basically brand new. I am selling this vehicle as is. No refunds. Serious buyers only. Cash only. Here is AutoSource's branded title description: \"What is a branded title? \"Is it a salvage vehicle? I've heard that all salvage vehicles have to be damaged beyond the point of repair or more than 75% of the current value of the vehicle.\" For the most part, a \"salvage\" title means that the vehicle could be repaired, but an insurance company instead chose to write off their losses and simply replace it with a new one.
