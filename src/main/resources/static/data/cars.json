      "postBody": "This 2012 Subaru Impreza is in wonderful condition, has custom leather seats and white pearl paint job with a sport premium Trim. For those who don't know, the Impreza is excellent on gas mileage and has wonderful life span as well as generally easy up keep. The car has AUX/USB hookups for music and phone built in, features a Bluetooth phone connection option, and has a great sound system (nothing custom). On top of that the car is AWD, so driving in the snow is a blast! This car is still mostly owned by the bank, so selling would go down with or at a financial institution. It's really quite easy if you're willing to take a loan, but we can go over details of course. Shoot me an email and I would be happy to chat with you! P.S. No low ball offers, you can try to scam me but it won't work and I am very experienced with cars so I wont be swindled. Thanks!",

I'm willing to negotiate on the price but not by much. It's a solid car with a whole life ahead of it. No interior damage. No animal hair or funk and has had a garage parking spot the whole time I've owned it. The title still has a lien with the bank. So if you're seriously interested in purchasing it we will be heading to the bank to handle the lien and get the title. Just wanted to put that out there upfront.

It has been well maintained with recommended services and runs great. The manual transmission is excellent in the mountains, especially in the snow. The tires have plenty of life left on them, and partnered with the all wheel drive I have had no problems navigating the winters. It had the clutch replaced at 68,000 miles due to a broken throw-out bearing; has a lifetime warranty on the new clutch! It has a clean Carfax and I have the clean title in hand. It does have some cosmetic curb rash on the bumper and wheels as well as normal cosmetic wear for a 5 year old vehicle, but other than that it is in excellent condition. It has almost all highway miles and gets on average 32-33 mpg. I am also throwing in a Subaru roof full-frame bike rack by Yakima, if you are interested. 17\" Gunmetal Aluminum-Alloy Wheels Heated Reclining Front Bucket Seats Sport Fabric Upholstery Bluetooth Stereo with Steering Wheel Phone Control AM/FM Stereo w/Single-Disc CD Player 4-Wheel Disc Brakes 6 Speakers Air Conditioning Electronic Stability Control Front Bucket Seats Front Center Armrest Trip Computer Hill Start Assist (doesn't roll backwards for 3 seconds when off the brake) Bumpers: body-color CO legal limit window tint Heated Mirrors and Windshield All Weather Floor Mats Thanks for looking!",
